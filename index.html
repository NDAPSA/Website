                On July 23rd, 2025, the National Council of the American Society for Public Administration approved the ND ASPA chapters application.  <br>

                This is the first time on ND history that we have had a state ASPA chapter.   There was an upper Midwest regional chapter that we were part of, at one point, but this is our first independent ND chapter.
