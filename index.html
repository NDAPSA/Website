                                        On July 23, 2025, the National Council of the American Society for Public Administration approved the ND ASPA chapter application.  
                                        This is the first time in ND history that we have had a state ASPA chapter.   There was an upper Midwest regional chapter that we were part of, at one point, but this is our first independent ND chapter.

                                        On September 18th and 19th, we attended the North Dakota League of Cities (NDLC) conference and exhibited alongside UND’s Department of Political Science and Public Administration. Dr. Buehlmann spoke to many attendees about both UND’s excellent programs and ND ASPA.
